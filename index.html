  <h1>Coca-Cola &reg;</h1>
  <h2>You can drink it and clean with it!</h2>

<hr />
<p>
Did you know you can drink Coke&reg;. It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia, and is
 often referred to simply as Coke (a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March
 27, 1944). Originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton, Coca-Cola was bought out by bu
 sinessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 2
 0th century.
<br/>
 The name refers to two of its original ingredie
 nts: kola nuts, a source of caffeine, and coca leaves. The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a va
riety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.
